#Administration manual

This is a administration manual for running and maintaining Tic Tac Toe

Anyone can run the program on the following link:
```sh
http://skittles.herokuapp.com/
```

If an administrator needs to run the program locally he can run the following command 
```sh
wget https://github.com/TheSkittles/TicTacToe/blob/master/bin/InstallProgramsAdmin
```

This installs git and gradle and clones the repository to the administrators local computer.

Then he can run the program by entering the following:
```sh
cd TicTacToe
./gradlew run
```

Now the game is up and running and can be played in any browser on:
```sh
localhost:4567
```
